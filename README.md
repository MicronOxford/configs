Micron configs

This repository contains configuration files for python-microscope
(https://github.com/MicronOxford/microscope) and microscope-cockpit
(https://github.com/MicronOxford/cockpit) for various Micron
systems. This is both an archive of present and past configs for our
records and a set of reference configs to help other people configure
their instruments.
